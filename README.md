# Warehouse-Automation-Opportunity-Analysis
This project analyzes warehouse picking operations to identify high-impact automation opportunities using simulated robot-assisted picking data.

The overall goal for this project was to quantify picking time reductions, highlight priority zones, and support data-driven automation decisions.

The analysis combines Python-based simulation with an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for both operational and executive audiences.

Tools & Technologies
* Python (Pandas, NumPy) - data cleaning, scoring & simulation
* Power BI - Build an interactive dashboard & visualization
* GitHub - Version control & Portfolio presenation
